## <div align="center">Private Task List: Pre-Release Activities

Welcome to the Hard3n_Linux repository! Below is a carefully curated list of tasks to address prior to releasing our project. These activities are crucial for enhancing the security and functionality of our system. While the list is not in any specific order, each item is pivotal for our release strategy.

## System Hardening Research

	•	Review and Analyze Hardening Scripts: Examine successful system hardening scripts like harbian-audit to understand their structure and methodology.

## Permission Security

	•	Evaluate Special Permissions: Study the implications of removing setgid, setuid, and sticky permissions from specific executables where safe. It’s crucial to approach this carefully, as incorrect changes can compromise system stability.

## User Group Configuration

	•	Console User Group Analysis in Whonix: Delve into the use and benefits of the console user group within Whonix. Investigate its necessity, potential for improvement, and the role of additional user groups in enhancing system security.

## Security Enhancements

	•	Track and Document Setgid Permissions: Run the following command as root to list all files with setgid permissions and document them:

find / -mount -perm -2000 -type f -exec ls -ld {} \; > /home/user/setgid_.txt && chown -v user:user /home/user/setgid_.txt

	•	Ongoing Configurations: Continue to fortify the system by modifying security settings in /etc/security, `/etc/host.conf​⬤



- Ongoing Configurations: Continue to fortify the system by modifying security settings in `/etc/security`, `/etc/host.conf`.
